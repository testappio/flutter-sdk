## Overview <a name="overview"></a>

TestApp.io SDK bridges your application with the TestApp.io platform, enabling a deeper understanding of user interactions and app behavior. Through the TestApp.io Portal, you can easily monitor sessions, gather feedback, and track activities.

## Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>

- Flutter: **2.5.0** or higher
- Dart: **2.12.0** or higher
- iOS: Minimum iOS deployment target is iOS **13.0** or higher

## Setup & Installation <a name="setup-install"></a>

### Android <a name="android"></a>
> Coming soon!

### iOS <a name="ios"></a>

To ensure proper functionality of the TestApp.io SDK on iOS, your project's minimum iOS deployment target should be set to iOS **13.0** or higher. This is due to specific features and capabilities used by the SDK that are available from iOS 13 onwards.

To set the iOS deployment target, follow these steps:

1. Open your Flutter project in Xcode.
2. Navigate to the project's target settings.
3. Under `General`, find the or `Minimum Deployments` or `Deployment Info`section.
4. Set the `Target` field to iOS 13.0 or higher.

### 1. **Podfile** <a name="podfile"></a>
Add the TestApp.io SDK to your iOS project's `Podfile`:
```ruby
pod 'TestAppIOSDK', :git => 'https://github.com/testappio/ios-sdk.git'
```
Then run `pod install`

### 2. pubspec.yaml <a name="pubspec"></a>
Add testappio to your project pubspec.yaml

```yaml
dependencies:
  #other dependencies
  testappio:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/testappio/flutter-sdk
      ref: main
      path: package/core
```

### 3. Permissions: <a name="pubspec"></a>
Add necessary permissions to your app's `Info.plist`:

	  > Provide access to get photos and videos from your gallery

### 4. Initialization: <a name="initialization"></a>
In your app's launch sequence, add:

```dart
import 'package:testappio/testappio.dart';

// create an instance of the plugin
  final testappio = TestAppio();

// We support iOS for now
if (Platform.isIOS) {
	await testappio.setup('<APP_TOKEN>', TestAppioEnvironment.dev); //[TestAppioEnvironment.dev, TestAppioEnvironment.staging, TestAppioEnvironment.production]
}
```

```dart
testappio.user.identify("U123456",
  name: "Jane Doe",   // optional
  email: "jane.doe@example.com",  // optional
  imageUrl: "https://url/to/sample-image.png",  // optional
  traits: {  // optional
    "vip": true,
    "level": 13,
    "theme": "dark"
  }
);
```

## Traits <a name="traits"></a>

Traits are pieces of information about a user that you can include in an `identify` call. These traits can be diverse, ranging from demographics like age or gender, account-specific details like the user's subscription plan, or even data related to A/B test variations the user has encountered. The purpose of traits is to provide additional context and information about your users.

Including traits in your `identify` calls can be essential for personalization, analytics, and targeting. They help you understand your users better, segment them effectively, and tailor their experience based on their characteristics.

## User Reset <a name="user-reset"></a>

```dart
// To reset the user
testappio.user.reset()
```

The reset method allows you to reset the user's identity, effectively clearing their identification data.

> Use this when user changes like Signout / Logout

---

### UI Interactions <a name="ui-interactions"></a>
Make it effortless for users to provide feedback by showcasing the TestApp.io bar.

#### Use Cases
- **Feedback Collection**: Use `testappio.bar.show()` when you want to prompt users for feedback or when a particular app event or interaction occurs that you want insights on.

- **Custom User Experiences**: Use `testappio.bar.hide()` to hide the feedback bar during specific app interactions or when you don't want to distract users, for instance, during a payment process.

```dart
// To display the feedback bar
testappio.bar.show() //by default enabled

// To hide the feedback bar
testappio.bar.hide()
```

---

### Logging & Events <a name="logging-events"></a>

### Continuous Sessions <a name="continuous-sessions"></a>

The TestApp.io SDK employs a "continuous sessions" approach. This means that if a session becomes full or meets specific criteria, a new session is automatically initiated for the device, ensuring uninterrupted data capture.

### Application & Session Lifecycle <a name="app-lifecycle-sessions-events"></a>
The TestApp.io SDK seamlessly integrates with your app's lifecycle, automatically capturing key application events.


#### Session Events <a name="session-events"></a>

| Event                  | Description                                                           |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Session start          | Marks the beginning of a new user session.                             |
| Session end            | Indicates the end of the current session.                              |
| Session expired        | Triggered when a session is deemed too old and is automatically ended. |
| Session resumed        | Indicates that a previously paused or backgrounded session is resumed. |



#### Lifecycle Events <a name="lifecycle-events"></a>

| Event                  | Description                                                           |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Application opened     | Triggered when the app is launched.                                   |
| Application active     | Indicates that the app is in the foreground and receiving events.     |
| Application foreground | Triggered when the app transitions from the background to the foreground. |
| Application backgrounded | Triggered when the app goes into the background.                     |
| Application terminated | Indicates that the app has been terminated, either by the user or the system. |

In addition to application events, the SDK diligently manages session lifecycle events, ensuring insights into user session behaviors.



#### Offline Mode <a name="offline-mode"></a>
Network unavailable? No worries. The SDK is built for resilience. In scenarios where the user's device is offline, the SDK will continue to capture all events, errors, and feedback. Once the network is restored, the SDK will automatically send the accumulated data in batches, ensuring no data loss.

#### Efficient Networking
The SDK employs batching and compression to ensure optimal network usage. This means fewer requests, reduced data usage, and faster event delivery.
